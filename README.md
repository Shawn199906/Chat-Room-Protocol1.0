# Chat-Room-Protocol1.0
This is a chat rooom designed in Java to let people chat with each other in a running server.

In this project, there are two groups of files called server and client. People need to open the server file and run it on a computer to create a current server, then other can use the file called client to connect to the server by type the IP address for the comupter that is running the file server. After people enter the chat room, it will show on the screen that someone enter the chat room. And people can type things at here. The things you typed will be showed to all the people in this room.
