# Chat-Room-Protocol1.0
This Java-based chat room provides a platform for people to communicate with each other in real-time via a running server. The project consists of two groups of files - the server and the client.

To initiate the chat room, users need to open the server file and run it on their computer to create a live server. Other users can then connect to the server using the client file and typing in the server's IP address. Upon entering the chat room, users will be greeted with a notification confirming their entry. From there, they can easily communicate with other users by typing messages into the chat interface. All messages sent by users will be displayed in real-time on the screens of all other users in the chat room.
